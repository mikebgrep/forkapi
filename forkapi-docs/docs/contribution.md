Any contribution is welcomed and here the instructions to do so:

1. Fork the repository 
2. Work on master branch if the changes are not major or create a new branch for major updates
3. Make your changes
4. Add additional test cases if the change is not covered (recommended)
5. Run tests with command ``> tox`` from the root folder where the ``tox.ini`` files is located
6. Open Pull request
7. Grab a coffe or a tea ‧₊˚ ⋅ ☕️🍵 ‧₊˚ ⋅ and relax 😌

!!! info 
    
    For major futures you can open a issue first and then branch that should be named ``future/name-of-the-change``

# Desired modifications

!!! note 

    If you decide to contribute and you have experience with Django a good starting point will be to rework the Django Admin Panel with more fancy look and feel.
